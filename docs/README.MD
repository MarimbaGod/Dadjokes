## Dad Jokes!

If you don't have a dad, but you want to find a joke to tell, now you can! *in light AND dark mode*

## Get Started
Fork and Clone Dadjokes from Github and create a new .env file with your API Key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
replaceing the line in quotes with your actual api key. NOTE: Ensure that your .env file is in the .gitignore file to avoid sharing your API key with others. By Default in this project, it is, but the golden rule is Trust but Verify.


## Steps:
For this project, you will need to navigate to the Dadjokes directory and in your terminal/command line run "docker-compose build", and then "docker-compose up".
